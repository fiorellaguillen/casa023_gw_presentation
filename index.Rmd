## Introduction
<!-- These are the main point, content and aesthetics will be enhanced -->

According to WHO’s latest World Malaria Report, there were almost 263 million estimated malaria cases and 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023 - **an increase of 11 million cases compared with 2022**

- Indonesia was the only country in the region that had an increase in mortality rate of less than 25% 
- counter to GTS goals and regional progress

##Indonesia’s new capital city 
<!-- These are the main point, content and aesthetics will be enhanced -->


Nusantara, although currently malaria-free, remains at risk for transmission due to high population movement from surrounding high malaria endemic

- A 2020 assessment of IKN by the National Planning and Development Agency highlighted the risks, citing data including the abundance of disease-carrying mosquitoes. 

* to be added: context about the new capital and its importance to the country

##Why Addressing this issue?
* In, 2019 the population was *194.000*, but in 2045 it is projected to be 1.91 million *[10 times higher]*

* Pillar 1 : Ensure access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment as part of universal health coverage.
Countries should collect data across all settings, including those areas that are malaria-free but at risk of re-establishment of malaria .


* Pillar 3. Transform malaria surveillance into a key intervention.
Surveillance in areas of high & low transmission and in areas targeted for elimination

## Methodology

##### Tools = Google Earth Engine (GEE)

$$
Malaria\ Risk\ Index = \frac{Susceptibility + Vulnerability + Capacity}{3}
$$

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Susceptibility]
* Extract LST, Precipitation, NDVI, and NDWI data and filter it for summer period (April - September) and minimum cloud cover
* Get the mean value of each LST, Precipitation, NDVI, and NDWI
* Divide the Malaria Cases Point for training and testing data
* Apply Boosted Regression Tree machine learning algorithm to get the susceptibility index
]

.panel[.panel-name[Vulnerability]
* Extract Land Cover Data and classify it into vulnerability scores
* Extract vulnerable population by age (0-15 and >60)
* Sum the vulnerable population
* Classify employment data to field and inside building and gives score 1 and 0, respectively
* Apply Fuzzy Logic Model (FLM) to normalize the value of vulnerable population to 0-1
* Apply Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to get the vulnerable index
]

.panel[.panel-name[Capacity]
* Extract hospital location point and road networks from Open Street Map (OSM)
* Calculate distance using Cost Distance Analysis
* Apply Fuzzy Logic Model (FLM) to normalize the value of distance to 0-1

I tested flexdashboard r package but it's a bit complicated for the purpose of the demo so i'll go back to the initail idea of just using figma
