#### Limitations of  current approach

<div style="font-size: 18px;">

- Heavily replies on quantitative malaria case data which influences the other factors.
- Limited attention to the spatial and socio-economic dimensions.
- It primarily operates within the health sector, missing opportunities for broader cross-sectoral insights such as urban planning.

<br/>

A malaria elimination program that integrates real-time case data from SISMAL with spatial mapping via a unified dashboard.

Display key indicators (API, ABER, PR) and with dynamic visualization optimize allocation of resources and targeted interventions, reinforcing the 1‑2‑5 response strategy.

#### Benefits of  proposed approach

<div style="font-size: 16px;">

- Increase scope of surveillance: case data, spatial data and socio-economic factors
- Overall strategy will be bridging  the e health sector with relating sector to enhance the elimination process.
- Can be integrated into development of policies for make Nusantara more resistant to malaria outbreaks. 
- This aligns the health service policy to increase surveillance
